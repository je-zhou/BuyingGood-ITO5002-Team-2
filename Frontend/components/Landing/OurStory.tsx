            Too often, fresh produce travel thousands of kilometers reach
            distribution centres, only to return to supermarket shelves right
            next to the farm.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then, fresh produce isnâ€™t so fresh, and the freight costs are
            inevitably absorbed by buyers.

            BuyingGood is about challenging this status quo, raising awareness
            and supporting sustainable production and consumption patterns of
            fresh produce.
