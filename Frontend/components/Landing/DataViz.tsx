            In 2024 Queensland was the second largest producer of fruit and
            vegetables in Australia. The state alone produced nearly 1.6 million
            tonnes of fruits and vegetables that were transported and enjoyed
            all over the country.

            Even though Queensland remains one of Australiaâ€™s top fruit and
            vegetable producers, we are seeing a decrease in the farm gate value
            per tonne of produce sold since 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is adding more strain on our regional farmers who are already
            doing it tough from paying additional freight costs to get their
            produce transported to large sorting and re-distribution centres.

            This is a worrying trend with a large impact on regional areas. In
            the FNQ area we are seeing a slow decline in agricultural, forestry
            and fishery businesses since 2022.
